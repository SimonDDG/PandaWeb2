<h1>Giant Panda</h1>


<div class="container1">
<p>
    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[5] native to south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[7][8]

    The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no<br>
     conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda <br>
     has been found.[22] The closest candidate is the Nepali word <br>
     ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the <br>
     red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world <br>
     originally applied this name to the red panda.<br>

    In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" <br>
    refers to the lesser-known red panda,[23] thus necessitating <br>
    the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of <br>
    the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclopædia Britannica still used <br>
    "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,[24] and simply "panda" <br>
    for the red panda,[25] despite the popular usage of the word <br>
    "panda" to refer to giant pandas.
