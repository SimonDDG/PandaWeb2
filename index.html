<h1>Giant Panda</h1>


<div class="container1">
    <p>
        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo),[4] also 
        known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[5] native to 
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">south central China</a>.[1] It is 
        easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears,
        and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from 
        the red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with 
        bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will 
        occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or
        carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, 
        or bananas along with specially prepared food.[7][8]

        The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no
        conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda 
        has been found.

        In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" 
        refers to the lesser-known red panda,[23] thus necessitating 
        the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of 
        the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclopædia Britannica still used 
        "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,[24] and simply "panda" 
        for the red panda,[25] despite the popular usage of the word 
        "panda" to refer to giant pandas.
