<h1>Giant Panda</h1>

<p>
    The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no<br>
     conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda <br>
     has been found.[22] The closest candidate is the Nepali word <br>
     ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the <br>
     red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world <br>
     originally applied this name to the red panda.<br>

<p>
    In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" <br>
    refers to the lesser-known red panda,[23] thus necessitating <br>
    the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of <br>
    the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica still used <br>
    "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,[24] and simply "panda" <br>
    for the red panda,[25] despite the popular usage of the word <br>
    "panda" to refer to giant pandas.
